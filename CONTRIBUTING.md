Contributing to ARTIK IDE
=====================
Thanks for your interest in this project.

Project Description
--------------------
The ARTIK IDE is to make all developers, regardless of skill set, productive and empowered with building IoT applications.

Developer Resources
--------------------
Information regarding source code management, builds, and coding standards. All code contributions for the Samsung ARTIK IDE custom assembly are made directly through commits or pull requests at http://github.com/codenvy/artik-ide.  If you'd like to make an improvement to Eclipse Che, which is used by ARTIK IDE's assembly, then commits or pull requests should be made at http://github.com/eclipse/che.

Reporting Issues
-----------------
A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed report when you
encounter an issue. We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report,
and will thank you for it!

Check that [our issue database](https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues)
doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue.
If you find a match, you can use the "subscribe" button to get notified on
updates. Do *not* leave random "+1" or "I have this too" comments, as they
only clutter the discussion, and don't help resolving it. However, if you
have ways to reproduce the issue or have additional information that may help
resolving the issue, please leave a comment.

When reporting issues, always include:

* The ARTIK IDE version that is installed (see Help menu in IDE).
* The full directory path of where ARTIK IDE is installed.
* The output of `docker version`.
* The output of `docker info`.
* The output of `java -version`.

Also include the steps required to reproduce the problem if possible and
applicable. This information will help us review and fix your issue faster.
When sending lengthy log-files, consider posting them as a gist (https://gist.github.com).
Don't forget to remove sensitive data from your logfiles before posting (you can
replace those parts with "REDACTED").

* Ongoing plug-in contributors are also welcome to be elevated as committers.

#### Promote ARTIK IDE
* Let other people know that you are using ARTIK IDE.
